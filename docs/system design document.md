This document outlines the architecture, high-level design, low-level design, and folder structure for a GenAI web and mobile application with extensive audio processing capabilities.

## 1. Architecture

The application will adopt a microservices-oriented architecture, leveraging cloud-native services for scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. This allows independent development, deployment, and scaling of different functionalities.

**Key Architectural Components:**

* **Client Applications:**
  * **Web Application (Frontend):** React/Next.js for a performant and interactive user interface.
  * **Mobile Applications (Frontend):** React Native or Flutter for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android).
* **API Gateway:** Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, handling authentication, routing, and rate limiting.
* **Backend Microservices:**
  * **User Management Service:** Handles user registration, login, profile management, and roles (user, admin).
  * **Payment Service:** Manages subscriptions, payment processing, and transaction history. Integrates with international payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal) and UPI.
  * **Audio Processing Service:** The core of the GenAI functionalities. This service will orchestrate calls to various GenAI models and manage audio file transformations. It will be further broken down into sub-services.
  * **Storage Service:** Manages secure storage of user audio files (uploads, processed outputs) and voice libraries.
  * **Notification Service:** Handles email/push notifications for payment confirmations, processing completion, etc.
  * **Admin Service:** Provides APIs for the Admin Panel functionalities.
* **GenAI Model Inference Layer:**
  * A dedicated layer responsible for running various AI models. This could be a cluster of GPU-enabled machines or serverless functions with GPU acceleration.
  * Each GenAI model (Tacotron2, WaveGlow, Whisper, etc.) will ideally be encapsulated as an independent inference endpoint.
* **Database Services:**
  * **Relational Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL):** For user data, payment transactions, and metadata.
  * **NoSQL Database (MongoDB/Cassandra):** For storing large-scale audio processing jobs, logs, and potentially voice library metadata.
  * **Object Storage (AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage):** For storing raw and processed audio files.
* **Caching Layer (Redis):** For frequently accessed data like user sessions, model metadata, and pricing plans to improve performance.
* **Message Queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ):** For asynchronous communication between microservices, especially for long-running audio processing tasks. This ensures loose coupling and fault tolerance.
* **Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack):** For observing system health, performance, and debugging.
* **CI/CD Pipeline (GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, GitHub Actions):** For automated testing, building, and deployment across Dev/Test and Prod environments.
* **Security Services:** WAF, DDoS protection, Identity and Access Management (IAM).

**High-Level Flow:**

1. User interacts with Web/Mobile App.
2. Requests go through API Gateway.
3. API Gateway authenticates and routes requests to appropriate backend services.
4. For GenAI tasks:
   * Audio Processing Service receives requests.
   * It retrieves user's account status (paid/unpaid) from User Management Service.
   * If a download is requested by a paid user, Payment Service is invoked.
   * Audio Processing Service orchestrates calls to specific GenAI Model Inference Endpoints.
   * Processed audio is stored in Object Storage.
   * User is notified via Notification Service upon completion.
5. Admin interacts with Admin Panel, which uses Admin Service APIs.

## 2. High-Level Design

  * `logs` collection: Application and service logs.

## 3. Low-Level Design

This section delves into the implementation details for key functionalities.

### 3.1. User Authentication and Authorization

* **Registration:**
  * Frontend sends `username`, `email`, `password`.
  * User Management Service:
    * Hashes password with a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) and a unique salt.
    * Stores `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `salt`, `role` (default: 'user').
    * Returns success.
* **Login:**
  * Frontend sends `username`/`email`, `password`.
  * User Management Service:
    * Retrieves user by `username`/`email`.
    * Hashes provided password with the stored salt.
    * Compares hash with stored `password_hash`.
    * If match, generates a JWT token containing `user_id`, `role`, `expiration`.
    * Returns JWT token to frontend.
* **Authorization:**
  * Frontend includes JWT in `Authorization` header for all protected API calls.
  * API Gateway (or individual services after initial routing) validates JWT:
    * Checks signature, expiration.
    * Extracts `user_id` and `role`.
    * Passes `user_id` and `role` to downstream services for fine-grained authorization.
  * Middleware in each service checks if the user's role has permission for the requested action.
  * For paid features: User Management Service's `account-status` endpoint is consulted to check `paid_status` and `minutes_remaining`.

### 3.2. Audio Processing Workflow

1. **User Initiates Request (Frontend):**
   * User uploads audio or inputs text.
   * Selects desired capability (TTS, STT, Voice Change, etc.) and model.
   * Frontend calls `POST /api/audio/process-audio` on API Gateway with `user_id`, `input_type`, `input_data`, `capability`, `model_name`, `parameters` (e.g., target voice ID, accent, mute words).
2. **API Gateway & Audio Processing Service:**
   * API Gateway authenticates and routes to Audio Processing Service.
   * Audio Processing Service validates `user_id` and request parameters.
   * Generates a unique `job_id`.
   * Stores initial job details in `audio_processing_jobs` (status: `pending`).
   * If audio upload is required:
     * Generates a pre-signed S3 URL for direct client upload to Object Storage.
     * Frontend uploads audio directly to S3.
     * Audio Processing Service updates `input_audio_path` in `audio_processing_jobs`.
   * Pushes a message to the Message Queue (e.g., Kafka topic `audio-processing-jobs`):
     * Message includes `job_id`, `user_id`, `input_audio_path`, `capability`, `model_name`, `parameters`.
3. **GenAI Worker Services (Consumers):**
   * Relevant GenAI Worker Service (e.g., `text-to-speech-service`) consumes messages from the queue.
   * Reads `job_id` and other parameters.
   * Fetches input audio from Object Storage using `input_audio_path`.
   * Loads the specified AI model (if not already loaded/cached).
   * Performs the AI inference.
   * Stores the output audio to Object Storage, updating `output_audio_path` in `audio_processing_jobs`.
   * Updates job status to `completed` or `failed` in `audio_processing_jobs`.
   * Pushes a notification message to a `notifications` queue (e.g., `job_id`, `user_id`, `status`, `output_audio_path`).
4. **Notification Service:**
   * Consumes messages from the `notifications` queue.
   * Sends email/push notification to the user about job completion.
5. **User Download (Frontend):**
   * User sees job completion and clicks "Download".
   * Frontend calls `GET /api/audio/download-audio/{jobId}`.
   * Audio Processing Service:
     * Checks `job_id` status in `audio_processing_jobs`.
     * **Crucially, checks user's `minutes_remaining` and `paid_status` from User Management Service.**
     * If paid and minutes available:
       * Calls Payment Service to debit minutes.
       * Generates a temporary pre-signed URL for the `output_audio_path` from Object Storage.
       * Redirects user to the pre-signed URL for direct download.
     * If not paid or insufficient minutes, returns an error/payment prompt.

### 3.3. Voice Library (User Uploaded Sample Voice)

* **Upload Sample:**
  * User uploads a voice sample via frontend.
  * Frontend calls `POST /api/voice-library/upload-sample` to Storage Service.
  * Storage Service generates pre-signed URL, client uploads to S3.
  * Storage Service records `user_id`, `voice_name`, `storage_path` in `voice_library` table.
* **Use Sample:**
  * When user selects a voice changer, they can choose from pre-defined voices or their uploaded ones.
  * When an uploaded voice is chosen, the `Voice Changer Service` fetches the sample from Object Storage and uses it for inference.

### 3.4. Payment Integration (International & UPI)

* **Payment Gateway Selection:**
  * International: Stripe (supports cards, various local methods).
  * India (UPI): Razorpay, PhonePe Payment Gateway, Paytm Gateway (choose one or more for redundancy).
* **Workflow (Subscription for minutes):**
  1. User selects a pricing plan on frontend.
  2. Frontend calls `POST /api/payment/create-checkout-session` on Payment Service.
  3. Payment Service:
     * Generates a session with the chosen payment gateway (e.g., Stripe Checkout Session, Razorpay Order).
     * Includes callback URLs for success/failure.
     * Returns the session URL/ID to the frontend.
  4. Frontend redirects user to the payment gateway's hosted page.
  5. User completes payment on the gateway.
  6. Payment Gateway sends a webhook notification to `POST /api/payment/webhook` on Payment Service.
  7. Payment Service (webhook handler):
     * Validates webhook signature.
     * Parses payment status.
     * If successful, updates `user_id`'s `paid_status` and `minutes_remaining` in User Management Service.
     * Records transaction in `transactions` table.
     * Optionally, notifies user via Notification Service.
* **Workflow (Per-Download Minute Deduction):**
  * As described in "Audio Processing Workflow" step 5, the Payment Service's `/download-minutes` API is called to decrement the `minutes_remaining` for the user.

### 3.5. Security Best Practices

* **Input Validation & Sanitization:** All user inputs (text, filenames, parameters) must be strictly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection).
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Use strong, industry-standard mechanisms (JWT, OAuth2). Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
* **Data Encryption:**
  * Data in transit: Use TLS 1.3 for all communication (HTTPS, secure gRPC).
  * Data at rest: Encrypt sensitive data in databases and object storage (e.g., S3 server-side encryption, disk encryption for databases).
* **Password Security:** Store password hashes (bcrypt/Argon2) with strong salts, never plain text. Implement strong password policies and MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).
* **API Security:**
  * Rate limiting on all endpoints to prevent brute-force and DDoS attacks.
  * API keys for developers (only for paid users), with strict access control and rotation policies.
  * OAuth2 for third-party application integration if exposed APIs.
  * Least privilege principle for service-to-service communication.
* **Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Proactively identify vulnerabilities.
* **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Protect against common web attacks (OWASP Top 10).
* **DDoS Protection:** Use cloud provider's DDoS mitigation services.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines. Avoid common vulnerabilities.
* **Dependency Management:** Regularly update libraries and frameworks to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Logging & Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging of security events and continuous monitoring for suspicious activities. Alerting on anomalies.
* **Environment Segregation:** Strict separation between Dev/Test and Prod environments. No production data in lower environments.

### 3.6. Development Environments (Dev/Test & Prod)

* **Dev/Test Environment:**
  * **Purpose:** Development, unit testing, integration testing, QA.
  * **Data:** Synthetic or anonymized data. Never production data.
  * **Configuration:** Less strict security policies, more verbose logging.
  * **Deployment:** Manual or automated deployments for development branches.
  * **Resources:** Smaller scale, potentially shared resources.
  * **Monitoring:** Basic monitoring for development purposes.
  * **Tools:** Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), local databases, mocking services.
* **Prod Environment:**
  * **Purpose:** Live application serving real users.
  * **Data:** Production data. Strict data privacy and security.
  * **Configuration:** High security, robust error handling, optimized performance.
  * **Deployment:** Automated deployments via CI/CD, blue/green or canary deployments for zero downtime.
  * **Resources:** Scalable infrastructure, high availability, redundancy.
  * **Monitoring:** Extensive monitoring, alerting, tracing, incident management.
  * **Compliance:** Adherence to relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).
* **Shared Practices:**
  * **Version Control:** All code, configurations, and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) managed in Git.
  * **CI/CD:** Automated builds, tests, and deployments for both environments.
  * **Containerization (Docker):** Ensure consistency across environments.
  * **Orchestration (Kubernetes):** Manage and scale microservices.
  * **Centralized Logging & Monitoring:** Consistent visibility across all environments.

## 4. Folder Structure

This structure assumes a monorepo approach, which is common for full-stack and microservices projects, allowing easier code sharing and coordinated deployments.

**Explanation of Folder Structure:**

* **`apps/`** : Contains all client-facing applications (web, mobile, admin). Each application is self-contained.
* **`services/`** : Houses all backend microservices. Each service has its own `src` directory, `Dockerfile`, and dependency file (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`).
* **`gen-ai-worker-*`** : This is a crucial pattern. Each GenAI capability (TTS, STT, etc.) has its own dedicated worker service. This allows independent scaling, updates, and technology choices for each AI model. Python is a common choice for AI/ML services due to libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face.
* **`shared/`** : For code, types, and constants that are used across multiple services or between frontend and backend.
* **`infra/`** : Contains all infrastructure-as-code (IaC) for deploying and managing the application on the cloud.
* `kubernetes/`: For deploying services onto a Kubernetes cluster.
* `terraform/`: For provisioning cloud resources like databases, storage, and compute.
* `docker-compose.yml`: For spinning up a local development environment (databases, message queues, perhaps even mock AI services).
* **`docs/`** : Documentation for API, architecture, database schemas, and deployment procedures.
* **`tests/`** : Contains all test suites (unit, integration, end-to-end).
* **`.gitlab-ci.yml`** : Example of a CI/CD pipeline configuration file.

This comprehensive design provides a strong foundation for building a scalable, secure, and feature-rich GenAI audio application.
