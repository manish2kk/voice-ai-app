# Scalable TTS/STT Application Architecture Guide

A comprehensive architecture solution for building a production-ready text-to-speech and speech-to-text application targeting 10,000 users with batch processing, pay-per-download monetization, and advanced audio features.

## Architecture Decision: Microservices on AWS

**Microservices architecture is strongly recommended** for your TTS/STT application over monolithic design. With your feature complexity (TTS, STT, voice changing, custom uploads, audio editing, noise removal, background music, sound effects), microservices provide essential benefits: independent scaling of compute-intensive audio processing services, technology flexibility for ML models, fault isolation preventing cascading failures, and seamless support for your pay-per-download billing model.

The recommended service decomposition includes dedicated microservices for audio processing (core TTS/STT), voice customization (changing, accent modification), audio enhancement (noise removal, effects), user management, billing, file storage, and API gateway. This architecture enables **AWS as your primary cloud platform** due to its mature audio processing ecosystem, comprehensive cost optimization tools, and superior integration capabilities between services like S3, Lambda, Transcribe, and Polly.

## Audio Processing Technology Stack

**AWS Polly and Transcribe emerge as the optimal choice** for your TTS/STT needs, offering competitive pricing at $16.00 per million characters for neural voices and $0.024 per minute for transcription. AWS provides the most mature audio processing ecosystem with 60+ voices, custom voice creation capabilities, and seamless integration with your microservices architecture.

For enhanced audio processing capabilities, **combine AWS services with open-source libraries**: FFmpeg for format conversion and basic audio filtering, PyTorch Audio for machine learning-based voice changing, and specialized libraries like Librosa for advanced audio manipulation. **Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC)** technology enables high-quality real-time voice changing with 90-170ms latency using minimal training data.

**Batch processing optimization** through AWS Lambda and SQS provides cost-effective scaling. Implement micro-batching (50-200ms audio segments), parallel processing across multiple Lambda functions, and priority queues for premium users. This architecture supports **50-100 simultaneous batch jobs** with processing latency under 5 minutes for typical files.

## Security and Payment Architecture

**Security implementation follows a defense-in-depth strategy** addressing OWASP Top 10 risks. Implement OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for mobile authentication, JWT with RS256 for stateless API security, and multi-factor authentication for admin access. **Audio data requires special handling** as biometric identifiers under GDPR Article 9, necessitating explicit consent, enhanced encryption (AES-256-GCM), and automated deletion policies.

**Stripe is recommended as your primary payment processor** for its excellent usage-based billing support, comprehensive API documentation, and 99.999% webhook reliability. Implement the pay-per-download model ($20 for 60 minutes) using Stripe's metered billing with $0.33 per minute pricing. Include PayPal as a secondary option for broader user acceptance, particularly for users preferring familiar payment methods.

**Critical security measures** include TLS 1.3 across all endpoints, certificate pinning for mobile apps, API rate limiting (tiered by subscription: free 100/hour, pro 10,000/hour), input validation for audio uploads (50MB limit, format restrictions), and comprehensive audit logging for compliance.

## Mobile Development Strategy

**Flutter is the recommended mobile framework** over React Native or native development, providing 85-90% of native performance for audio processing while enabling shared codebase benefits. Flutter's ahead-of-time compilation delivers superior audio processing performance, widget-based architecture ensures consistent UI across platforms, and strong community support guarantees long-term viability.

**Mobile architecture implements Clean Architecture with BLoC state management** for scalability and maintainability. Key mobile-specific considerations include background audio processing using Flutter Background Service, secure storage for API keys using FlutterSecureStorage, efficient audio file handling with compression for files over 10MB, and offline capabilities through Hive local storage with job queuing.

**Progressive Web App support** supplements mobile apps, leveraging Web Audio API for browser-based processing and Service Workers for offline functionality, though with limitations on background audio recording and device hardware access.

## Storage and Data Architecture

**Cloudflare R2 provides the most cost-effective storage solution** at $0.015/GB/month with zero egress fees, delivering 87% cost savings compared to AWS S3 ($0.023/GB + $0.09/GB egress). For 10,000 users averaging 10GB each (100TB total), monthly storage costs drop from $113 to $15 when including data transfer.

**Database design follows a hybrid approach**: PostgreSQL for structured data (users, billing, job metadata, audio file metadata) and MongoDB for semi-structured data (voice profiles, processing workflows, user preferences). This combination optimizes performance for relational operations while providing flexibility for evolving audio processing configurations.

**Queue architecture centers on AWS SQS** for reliability and simplicity, with standard queues for general processing, FIFO queues for order-sensitive operations, and dead letter queues for error handling. **Redis serves as the caching layer** for frequently accessed data including user profiles (1-hour TTL), API responses (5-minute TTL), and job status updates.

## API Design and Developer Experience

**RESTful API design follows industry leaders** like Stripe and Twilio, implementing URL-based versioning (v1, v2) and comprehensive endpoint structure covering core functions: `/v1/tts/synthesize`, `/v1/stt/transcribe`, `/v1/voice/upload`, `/v1/audio/batch`, and `/v1/auth/tokens`.

**Developer API authentication uses scoped API keys** with rate limiting tiers (free: 100 requests/hour, pro: 10,000 requests/hour) and comprehensive documentation following interactive formats. **JWT tokens with RS256 signing** provide stateless authentication for mobile and web applications, with automatic refresh capabilities and secure device storage.

API responses include detailed metadata (processing time, character count, cost breakdown, expiration timestamps) and support multiple audio formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC) with configurable quality settings. **Webhook integration** enables real-time notifications for processing completion, billing events, and system status updates.

## Infrastructure Costs and Scaling

**Monthly operational costs for 10,000 users total approximately $2,940**, breaking down as: storage ($1,500 via Cloudflare R2), compute ($500-800 for EKS), audio processing ($300-600 for AWS services), database ($700 for PostgreSQL + Redis), CDN ($20 for Cloudflare Pro), and queue processing ($20 for SQS).

**Cost optimization strategies** include implementing aggressive caching (30% reduction in storage requests), automated storage tiering (40% reduction in long-term costs), audio compression (20-30% storage savings), spot instances for batch processing (up to 90% compute savings), and reserved instances for predictable workloads (30-60% savings).

**Scaling architecture supports growth from 10K to 100K+ users** through horizontal scaling with Auto Scaling Groups, Application Load Balancer traffic distribution, Amazon SQS for service decoupling, and ElastiCache for caching frequently accessed data. Performance targets include 50-100 simultaneous batch jobs, sub-200ms API responses for non-processing endpoints, and 1000+ files per minute upload throughput.
